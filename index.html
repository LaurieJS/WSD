    <h2>Snowy Owls</h2>
    <p>Snowy Owls migrate to Canada, Europe, Asia, and the northern United States throughout the year. They are unlike most 
      owls because they are active during the daytime. They spend their summers north of the Arctic Circle, which is
      their favorite habitat. Snowy Owls mate, create crude nests and lay eggs at their summer migration spot.
      Young, male Snowy Owls are whiter than the female owls and have fewer spots. As the owls mature, the male owls turn extremely
      white while the females become darker and have bands of black covering them.</p>
    <p>Snowy Owls eat lemmings and other rodents; however, they <em>really</em> enjoy lemmings and can 
      eat 3-5 a day. If lemmings are not available, and times are tough, a Snowy Owl can eat an animal
      the size of a goose. They are fierce birds of prey, and are even known to scare wolves away from their nests.</p>

    <h3>Owls during the Ancient Greek era</h3>
    <p>Athena, the daughter of Zeus, is known as the goddess of the night and wisdom. Athena's wisdom was
      given to her from her owl companion who revealed unseen truths. Athena was able to tell the entire truth,
      and not half-truths because of her trusty owl companion. This made her well known-for being honest and wise, which is why
      owls are associated with wisdom.</p>
    <p>During the Greek era owls were protected and honored. The Ancient city of Athens, had a coin featuring Athena
      on one side, and her owl companion on the other side. The owl on the coin was supposed to keep a watchful eye over trade and commerce.</p>

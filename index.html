	<h2>Owls during the Ancient Greek era</h2>
	<p>Athena, the daughter of Zeus, is known as the goddess of the night and wisdom. Athena's wisdom was
	 given to her, from her owl companion, who revealed unseen truths. Athena was able to tell the entire truth,
	 and not half-truths, because of her trusty owl companion. This made her well known-for being honest and wise, which is why
	 owls are associated with wisdom.</p>
	 <p>During the Greek era owls, were protected and honored. The Ancient city of Athens, had a coin featuring Athena
	 on one side, and her owl companion on the other side. The owl on the coin was supposed to keep a watchful eye over trade and commerce.</p>
